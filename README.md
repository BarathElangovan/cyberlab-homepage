<p>There are a number of new hackers joining the community on a regular basis and more than often the first thing they ask is "How do I get started and what are some good resources?". As a hacker, there a ton of techniques, terminologies, and topics you need to familiarize yourself with to understand how an application works. @Abirami, and @BarathElangovan put these resources together in order to help new hackers with resources to learn the basics of Cyber Security.

We understand that there are more resources other than the ones we have listed and we hope to cover more resources in the near future!

All the material in one spot that you need to become an ethical hacker and security expert. No more outdated materials from ancient torrents sitting untouched on a drive somewhere. We provide the best training available, coupled with the coaching and support you need to actually learn.</p>
